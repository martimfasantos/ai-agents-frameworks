# Microsoft Agent Framework

- Repo: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework
- Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/

Microsoft Agent Framework is an open-source SDK for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents and multi-agent workflows. It unifies the capabilities of AutoGen and Semantic Kernel, providing a comprehensive platform for creating intelligent agents with tool use, middleware, sessions, structured outputs, MCP integration, and graph-based workflows with human-in-the-loop support.

> **Note:** The framework is currently in public preview (RC). APIs may change before the 1.0 stable release.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 3. Run an example

```bash
uv run python 00_hello_world.py
```

## Key dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `agent-framework` | 1.0.0rc5 | Core framework (agents, tools, middleware, workflows) |
| `agent-framework-declarative` | 1.0.0b260319 | YAML/JSON declarative agent definitions |
| `agent-framework-orchestrations` | 1.0.0b260319 | Sequential and Handoff orchestration builders |
| `pydantic` | >=2.0 | Structured output schemas |
| `pydantic-settings` | >=2.0 | `.env` file loading via `BaseSettings` |
| `python-dotenv` | >=1.0 | Explicit `.env` loading (framework does not auto-load) |
| `graphviz` | >=0.21 | Workflow PNG export (requires system `graphviz` package) |

## Notes

- The framework does **not** auto-load `.env` files. Every example calls `load_dotenv()` explicitly.
- Examples 05 and 13 require `OpenAIResponsesClient` (Responses API) rather than `OpenAIChatClient`.
- Example 09 requires Node.js / `npx` for the MCP filesystem server.
- Example 18 requires the system `graphviz` package for PNG export (`brew install graphviz` on macOS).
