## 12_retrieval_rag.py

```
=== Question 1: What are LangChain agents? ===
In LangChain, agents are built using the `create_agent()` function, which establishes a
graph-based agent runtime. This allows agents to utilize various tools, maintain memory
through checkpointers, and support streaming capabilities. The agent operates in a loop
that alternates between making calls to the language model and executing tools.

=== Question 2: What is middleware? ===
LangChain middleware allows developers to hook into the agent lifecycle at strategic points.
Available hooks include @before_model, @after_model, @dynamic_prompt, and @wrap_model_call.
Built-in options include SummarizationMiddleware and HumanInTheLoopMiddleware.

=== Question 3: Simple greeting (no retrieval needed) ===
Hello! I can assist you with information about LangChain features, functionalities, and
documentation. If you have specific questions or topics you'd like to know more about,
feel free to ask!

=== MCPAdapter ===

Tools discovered on the MCP server:
  add: Add two numbers
  factorial: Calculate factorial of n (up to 20)

Q: What is 17 plus 25?
   tools used: ['add']
   answer:     42

Q: What is 6 factorial?
   tools used: ['factorial']
   answer:     720
```

> Migrated to the first-party `langchain.mcp` namespace. `MCPAdapter` takes the
> server as a `Path` — a plain string is rejected unless it is an http(s) URL, so
> a filename from config or from a model can never silently launch a subprocess.
> `list_tools()` returns ready-made LangChain tools for `create_agent`.

## 17_multi_agent_skills.py

```
=== SQL Skill: Write a query ===
Response:
Here's a SQL query to find the top 5 customers by total order value:

SELECT
    u.id AS customer_id,
    u.name AS customer_name,
    SUM(o.total) AS total_order_value
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_order_value DESC
LIMIT 5;

=== Code Review Skill: Review a function ===
Response:
1. Summary: The function `get_user` reads user data from a JSON file and retrieves a user
   by ID. However, it has several issues related to security, performance, and error handling.
2. Issues found:
   1. Security Vulnerability: Using `eval` to parse JSON is dangerous.
   2. File Handling: The file is opened but not properly closed.
   3. Performance: The function reads the entire file every call.
   4. Error Handling: No error handling for file operations or JSON parsing.
3. Suggestions: Replace `eval` with `json.load()`, use a context manager, add error handling.

=== Test Writing Skill: Write tests ===
Response:
pytest tests for calculate_discount(price, percentage):
- test_calculate_discount_happy_path: 100, 20% → 80.0
- test_calculate_discount_zero_percentage: 100, 0% → 100.0
- test_calculate_discount_full_price: 100, 100% → 0.0
- test_calculate_discount_no_price: 0, 20% → 0.0
- test_calculate_discount_negative_price: raises ValueError
- test_calculate_discount_negative_percentage: raises ValueError
- test_calculate_discount_large_values: 1,000,000, 50% → 500,000.0

## 19_dynamic_tool_registration.py

```
=== Dynamic Tool Registration ===
Response: The weather in Lisbon is sunny, 25°C. A 20% tip on an $85 bill is $17.00, making the total $102.00.
```

> The middleware dynamically injected `calculate_tip` at runtime — it was not registered when the agent was created. Both the base tool (`get_weather`) and the dynamic tool executed successfully.

## 20_stream_events_v3.py

```
=== Example 1: typed projections ===
  [model] 10 tool-call argument chunks streamed:
    -> get_weather({'city': 'Lisbon'})
    -> get_population({'city': 'Lisbon'})
  [model] The weather in Lisbon is sunny with a temperature of 26°C, and the population is approximately 550,000.
  tool result get_weather -> Sunny, 26°C
  tool result get_population -> 550,000
  final answer: The weather in Lisbon is sunny with a temperature of 26°C, and the population is approximately 550,000.

=== Example 2: stream.subgraphs ===
  subgraph 'city_agent' status=started
    [city_agent] The weather in Tokyo is rainy with a temperature of 20°C.

=== Example 3: raw protocol events (escape hatch) ===
  messages     44 events
  tools        4 events
  values       4 events
```

> The typed projections are the recommended path: `message.text` streamed the answer token by token, `message.tool_calls` produced 10 argument chunks that assembled into two tool calls, and `await stream.output()` returned the final state. Example 3 shows the same run consumed as raw `method`/`params` envelopes — the escape hatch when no projection fits. A projection can only be consumed once per run.

## 21_tool_error_handling.py

```
=== Example 1: [ToolErrorMiddleware, ToolRetryMiddleware] (correct) ===
  request flows error -> retry -> tool, so the exception reaches retry first
  [ToolErrorMiddleware] fetch_exchange_rate({'currency': 'EUR'}) raised ConnectionError
  tool attempts actually made : 4
  ToolMessage status          : ['error']
  final answer                : I couldn't fetch the USD exchange rate for EUR at the moment; please try again later.

=== Example 2: [ToolRetryMiddleware, ToolErrorMiddleware] (reversed) ===
  retry is now outermost, so the inner error middleware swallows the
  exception first and retry sees a successful call
  [ToolErrorMiddleware] fetch_exchange_rate({'currency': 'EUR'}) raised ConnectionError
  tool attempts actually made : 1
  ToolMessage status          : ['error']
  final answer                : I couldn't fetch the USD exchange rate for EUR at the moment; please try again later.

=== Why the order matters ===
  Middleware is composed first-is-outermost.
  ToolErrorMiddleware must wrap ToolRetryMiddleware, otherwise retries are
  silently skipped: 1 attempt instead of 4 (initial call + max_retries=3).
```

> The attempt counter is the proof: with `ToolErrorMiddleware` outermost the tool is really called 4 times (1 + `max_retries=3`) before the exception becomes a `ToolMessage(status="error")`. Reversed, the inner error middleware converts the very first exception, so the retry middleware never sees a failure and only 1 attempt happens. Both runs produce the same final answer, which is exactly why the misordering is easy to ship unnoticed.

## 22_builtin_middleware.py

```
=== Example 1: SummarizationMiddleware (TriggerClause AND-semantics) ===
  turn: I am planning a trip to Lisbon in May.       ->  2 messages, ~ 40 tokens
  turn: I want to see the Belem tower and ride tram  ->  4 messages, ~ 79 tokens
  turn: My budget is 1200 euros for five nights.     ->  6 messages, ~130 tokens
  turn: I am travelling with my brother, who is vege ->  8 messages, ~184 tokens
  turn: What do you remember about my trip?          ->  4 messages, ~324 tokens <- both thresholds crossed, history summarized

  history is now a summary plus the 2 most recent messages:
    Here is a summary of the conversation to date:

## SESSION INTENT
The user is planning a trip to Lisbon in May and seeks recommendations and information regarding attractions, budget, and dietary cons...
  last answer: You're planning a trip to Lisbon in May, with a budget of 1200 euros for five nights, and you're interested in attractions like the Belém Tower and Tram 28, while also needing vegetarian dining options for your brother.

=== Example 2: ContextEditingMiddleware (ClearToolUsesEdit) ===
  [model call] 0 tool results in request, 0 cleared, ~16 tokens
  [model call] 3 tool results in request, 2 cleared, ~273 tokens
  agent state still holds every original tool result:
    get_city_report  -> Tourism report for Lisbon. Peak season runs from June to...
    get_city_report  -> Tourism report for London. Peak season runs from June to...
    get_city_report  -> Tourism report for Tokyo. Peak season runs from June to ...
  final answer: I currently have the tourism report for Tokyo, which highlights that May is a shoulder month with mild weather, good walkability, and well-covered public transport, while I need to retrieve the reports for Lisbon and London.

=== Example 3: ModelCallLimitMiddleware + ToolCallLimitMiddleware ===
  model calls made      : 3 (run_limit=3, then exit_behavior='end')
  fetch_page executions : 2 (run_limit=2)
  blocked tool calls    : 2 -> Tool call limit exceeded. Do not call 'fetch_page' again.
  final answer          : Model call limits exceeded: run limit (3/3)
```

> Example 1: a single `TriggerClause` is AND — the message count reached 8 on turn 4 but nothing happened until the token count also passed 180 on turn 5, when 8 messages collapsed into a summary plus the 2 kept messages. Example 2: context edits are applied to the model *request*, so the model saw 2 of 3 tool results replaced by the placeholder while agent state kept the originals — and the final answer shows the real consequence of that trade. Example 3: `fetch_page` was blocked after 2 executions, and the run was then ended by `ModelCallLimitMiddleware` at 3 model calls rather than looping forever.

---

## 23_structured_output_strategies.py

```
=== Example 1: ToolStrategy with a union schema ===
  Q: What is the weather in Lisbon?
    schema chosen: WeatherReport
    fields       : {'city': 'Lisbon', 'conditions': 'sunny', 'temperature_c': 26.0}
  Q: Who won the 1998 World Cup?
    schema chosen: OutOfScope
    fields       : {'reason': 'The question is about sports history, not weather.', 'suggestion': 'Please ask about the weather in a specific city.'}
  tool_message_content in history: 'Structured answer recorded.'

=== Example 2: ToolStrategy retrying on a validation error ===
  [handle_errors] caught StructuredOutputValidationError, asking the model to retry
  validation attempts: 2
  accepted answer    : {'city': 'London, UK', 'temperature_c': 15.0}

=== Example 3: ProviderStrategy(strict=True) ===
  Lisbon, Portugal
  landmarks: Belém Tower, Jerónimos Monastery
  messages in history: 2 (no structured-output tool call)
```

> The union schema lets the model pick its response shape per question — `WeatherReport` for an answerable one, `OutOfScope` for a refusal — without any branching in application code. `handle_errors` turned the rejected first attempt into a retry instruction and the model corrected `London` to `London, UK`. `ProviderStrategy` needs no synthetic tool call at all, which is why its history is only 2 messages.

---

## 24_model_exceptions.py

```
=== Standard model exceptions ===

ModelNotFoundError
  is a ModelError:  True
  message:          Error code: 404 - {'error': {'message': 'The model `gpt-does-not-exist-9000` does not exist or you do not have

  bad api key:    unavailable (OpenAIAuthenticationError) — fall back to another model
  working model:  ok
```

> The standard types are raised by every integration, so one `except ModelError`
> block covers any provider. The concrete classes are provider subclasses —
> `OpenAIModelNotFoundError` here — which still answer `isinstance(exc, ModelError)`,
> so provider-agnostic handling and provider-specific detail coexist.
