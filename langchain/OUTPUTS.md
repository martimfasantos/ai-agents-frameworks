## 12_retrieval_rag.py

```
=== Question 1: What are LangChain agents? ===
In LangChain, agents are built using the `create_agent()` function, which establishes a
graph-based agent runtime. This allows agents to utilize various tools, maintain memory
through checkpointers, and support streaming capabilities. The agent operates in a loop
that alternates between making calls to the language model and executing tools.

=== Question 2: What is middleware? ===
LangChain middleware allows developers to hook into the agent lifecycle at strategic points.
Available hooks include @before_model, @after_model, @dynamic_prompt, and @wrap_model_call.
Built-in options include SummarizationMiddleware and HumanInTheLoopMiddleware.

=== Question 3: Simple greeting (no retrieval needed) ===
Hello! I can assist you with information about LangChain features, functionalities, and
documentation. If you have specific questions or topics you'd like to know more about,
feel free to ask!

## 17_multi_agent_skills.py

```
=== SQL Skill: Write a query ===
Response:
Here's a SQL query to find the top 5 customers by total order value:

SELECT
    u.id AS customer_id,
    u.name AS customer_name,
    SUM(o.total) AS total_order_value
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_order_value DESC
LIMIT 5;

=== Code Review Skill: Review a function ===
Response:
1. Summary: The function `get_user` reads user data from a JSON file and retrieves a user
   by ID. However, it has several issues related to security, performance, and error handling.
2. Issues found:
   1. Security Vulnerability: Using `eval` to parse JSON is dangerous.
   2. File Handling: The file is opened but not properly closed.
   3. Performance: The function reads the entire file every call.
   4. Error Handling: No error handling for file operations or JSON parsing.
3. Suggestions: Replace `eval` with `json.load()`, use a context manager, add error handling.

=== Test Writing Skill: Write tests ===
