Next speaker: researcher

researcher (to chat_manager):

- **Creation and Release**: Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in
  February 1991. It was designed as a successor to the ABC language with an emphasis on
  code readability and simplicity.

- **Python 2 and 3**: Python 2.0 was released in 2000 with features like list
  comprehensions. Python 3.0 arrived in December 2008, focused on removing redundancy and
  improving consistency, though it was not backward compatible.

- **Popularization**: The language gained popularity in the 2000s due to its versatility
  and robust community, becoming widely used in web development, data science, AI, and
  scientific computing.

- **Current Status**: Python continues to evolve with regular updates and holds the title
  of one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Python, created by Guido van Rossum and released in February 1991, emerged as a
successor to the ABC language, prioritizing code readability and ease of use. Its
evolution saw Python 2.0 in 2000, followed by Python 3.0 in 2008 that enhanced
language consistency. The language's appeal skyrocketed due to its versatility and
strong community support, making it a favorite for web development, data science,
and artificial intelligence. Python remains a leading programming language,
consistently updated with new features. TERMINATE

Fact-check the following: Write about the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fact_checker (to lead_agent):

1. **Accidental Discovery**: Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in September 1928
   when he observed that a mold called Penicillium notatum contaminated one of his petri
   dishes of Staphylococcus bacteria, inhibiting bacterial growth.

2. **Publication**: Fleming published his findings in 1929, but it wasn't until the early
   1940s that it was developed into a widely used antibiotic, thanks to Howard Florey and
   Ernst Boris Chain.

3. **World War II Impact**: Penicillin became mass-produced during WWII, significantly
   reducing mortality from bacterial infections.
