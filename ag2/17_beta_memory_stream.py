-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore AG2's MemoryStream with the following features:
- MemoryStream for persistent agent conversation memory
- Sharing a stream between multiple agent interactions
- Inspecting stream events to see conversation history

MemoryStream is the structured event log agents use for
conversation history. Unlike raw message lists it supports
compaction, filtering, and sharing across agent turns, enabling
long-running sessions without context window overflow.
