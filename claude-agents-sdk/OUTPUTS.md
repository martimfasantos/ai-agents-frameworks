# Claude Agent SDK - Example Outputs

All examples run with `claude-agent-sdk==0.1.52` and the Claude Code CLI (`claude` v2.1.12). The SDK auto-selects the model via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

> **Note:** LLM responses are non-deterministic. Your outputs will differ in wording but should follow the same structure and demonstrate the same features.

## 00_hello_world.py

```
$ uv run python 00_hello_world.py

## The Origin of "Hello, World!"

The phrase **"Hello, World!"** as a programming tradition traces back to the early 1970s at Bell Labs.

### Key Milestones

1. **1972 – The earliest known use** comes from Brian Kernighan's internal Bell Labs memo,
   *"A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B"*, where a simple program printed `hello, world`.

2. **1974** – Kernighan used it again in a Bell Labs technical report,
   *"Programming in C: A Tutorial"*.

3. **1978 – The book that made it famous**: It appeared in ***The C Programming Language***
   (often called "K&R C") by **Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie**.

### Why "Hello, World!"?

Kernighan has said he doesn't remember a specific reason for choosing the phrase — it was
simply a short, friendly, and clear way to demonstrate that a program could produce output.

### Legacy

The tradition spread because *The C Programming Language* became one of the most read
programming books of all time. Now virtually every programming language, framework, or
tutorial starts with a "Hello, World!" example as a rite of passage.
```

**Verdict:** PASS - One-shot `query()` call returns a complete response about "Hello, World!" history.

## 01_built_in_tools.py

```
$ uv run python 01_built_in_tools.py

[Tool Call] Glob: {'pattern': '**/*.py'}
[Tool Call] Read: {'file_path': '/Users/.../claude-agents-sdk/settings.py', 'limit': 5}
[Tool Call] Bash: {'command': 'find ... -name "*.py" -not -path "*/.venv/*"', 'description': 'List Python files excluding .venv'}

--- Result ---
Here's a summary of the results:

### Python Files in the Project (excluding `.venv`)

| File |
|------|
| `00_hello_world.py` |
| `01_built_in_tools.py` |
| ... (15 total files) |
| `settings.py` |

### First 5 Lines of `settings.py`

```python
import pydantic
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
```

The project contains **15 Python files** — a numbered series of example scripts
plus a `settings.py` that uses **Pydantic's `BaseSettings`** for configuration.
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Built-in tools (Glob, Read, Bash) invoked via allowed_tools and bypassPermissions, agent lists files and reads content.

## 02_custom_tools.py

```
$ uv run python 02_custom_tools.py

Here's the info for **Lisbon, Portugal**:

- Weather: Sunny, 25°C
- Population: ~545,000

Sounds like a lovely day in Lisbon!
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Custom MCP tools (get_weather, get_population) created via @tool decorator and create_sdk_mcp_server(), both invoked correctly.

## 03_structured_outputs.py

```
$ uv run python 03_structured_outputs.py

=== Example 1: Raw JSON Schema ===
Structured output: {
  "name": "Paris",
  "country": "France",
  "population_millions": 2.1,
  "famous_for": [
    "Eiffel Tower",
    "The Louvre Museum",
    "Notre-Dame Cathedral",
    "Fashion and haute couture",
    "Cuisine and fine dining",
    "Art and culture",
    "River Seine",
    "Champs-Élysées"
  ]
}

=== Example 2: Pydantic Model Schema ===
Title: 1984
Author: George Orwell
Rating: 9.5/5
Summary: George Orwell's *1984* is a chilling and prescient masterpiece of dystopian
fiction. Set in the totalitarian superstate of Oceania, it follows Winston Smith...
Themes: Totalitarianism, Surveillance and Privacy, Propaganda and Truth, Psychological
Manipulation, Resistance and Conformity, Loss of Individual Identity, Language as a
Tool of Control
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Both raw JSON schema and Pydantic model-derived schema produce valid structured output matching the defined schemas.

## 04_system_prompts.py

```
$ uv run python 04_system_prompts.py

=== Example 1: Custom String System Prompt ===
Arrr, Python be a high-level programming language, easy to read and write like a fine
treasure map! It be used fer web development, data plunderin', AI sorcery, and
automation. A fine tool in any code pirate's chest, it be!

=== Example 2: Preset System Prompt (claude_code) ===
Here are the tools available to me:

**File Operations**
- `Read` — read files
- `Write` — create/overwrite files
- `Edit` — make targeted edits to files
- `Glob` — find files by pattern
- `Grep` — search file contents

**Execution**
- `Bash` — run shell commands

**Research & Planning**
- `Agent` — launch specialized subagents
- `WebFetch` — fetch a URL
- `WebSearch` — search the web
...

=== Example 3: Preset with Append ===
A Python list comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single expression.

**Syntax:**
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

**Examples:**
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]    # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
even_sq = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]  # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

Happy coding!
```

**Verdict:** PASS - All three system prompt modes work: custom string (pirate persona), preset claude_code, and preset with appended instructions (concise + beginner-friendly).

## 05_permissions.py

```
$ uv run python 05_permissions.py

=== Example 1: Permission Mode with Allow/Deny Lists ===
[Tool Call] Glob

Result: The Glob tool returned many results (truncated), largely because it picked up
`.py` files from within the `.venv` directory...

=== Example 2: can_use_tool Callback ===

Result: Here are the contents of `settings.py`:

```python
import pydantic
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: pydantic.SecretStr
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = "utf-8"

settings: Settings = Settings()
```

Audit log (0 calls): []
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Example 1 uses allowed_tools/disallowed_tools with permission_mode. Example 2 demonstrates can_use_tool callback with AsyncIterable streaming prompt (required by the SDK for this feature).

--- Result ---
Here are the **15 `.py` files** found in the current directory:
| # | File |
|---|------|
| 1 | `00_hello_world.py` |
| ... |
| 15 | `settings.py` |
```

**Verdict:** PASS - PreToolUse hooks log tool calls before execution, Bash calls are blocked by the deny hook, PostToolUse hooks fire after completion. All three hook types demonstrated correctly.

## 07_sessions.py

```
$ uv run python 07_sessions.py

=== Step 1: Start a new session ===
Response: I've noted it: the secret code is **ALPHA-7**. Confirmed!
Session ID: 5da80ee6-679a-4871-b550-1603375bc2a9

=== Step 2: Resume the session ===
Response: The secret code you told me earlier is **ALPHA-7**.

=== Step 3: Fork the session ===
Forked session response: The answer to 2 + 2 is **4**!
New session ID: 421f2380-1045-448c-ad19-dde6b75c9865
(Original session '5da80ee6-679a-4871-b550-1603375bc2a9' is unchanged)
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Session created with unique ID, resumed by ID (remembers ALPHA-7), forked to new session with independent ID while preserving original.

## 08_multi_turn.py

```
$ uv run python 08_multi_turn.py

=== Turn 1 ===
Response: Got it! I'll keep in mind that you're building a REST API with **FastAPI**.
I'm ready to help you with routing, data validation, authentication, database
integration, middleware, testing, and project structure.
Session: aa3522d1-8a8c-473b-998f-91a8f561f3a7

=== Turn 2 ===
Response: For a **FastAPI** project, here are the top recommendations:
- `python-jose` + `passlib` (Most Common for Custom JWT Auth)
- `fastapi-users` (Batteries-Included)
- `authlib` (OAuth2 / OpenID Connect)
- External Auth Services (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth)

For most FastAPI projects, **`python-jose` + `passlib`** is the go-to starting point.

=== Turn 3 ===
Response: ```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import jwt, JWTError
from passlib.context import CryptContext

app = FastAPI()
...
```
```

**Verdict:** PASS - ClaudeSDKClient maintains context across 3 turns: sets FastAPI context (Turn 1), recommends auth library building on context (Turn 2), provides code example for recommended library (Turn 3).

## 09_subagents.py

```
$ uv run python 09_subagents.py

  [task_started] {'type': 'system', 'subtype': 'task_started', 'task_id': 'a39127f5c1dd049e1',
    'description': 'Review Python calc function', 'task_type': 'local_agent', ...}
  [task_started] {'type': 'system', 'subtype': 'task_started', 'task_id': 'a540bad4ba94b6489',
    'description': 'Write docstring for calc function', 'task_type': 'local_agent', ...}
  [task_notification] {'task_id': 'a540bad4ba94b6489', 'status': 'completed',
    'summary': 'Write docstring for calc function', ...}
  [task_notification] {'task_id': 'a39127f5c1dd049e1', 'status': 'completed',
    'summary': 'Review Python calc function', ...}

--- Final Result ---
## Code Review — Issues Found
1. **Division by zero** — no handling for `y == 0`
2. **Silent `None` return** — unknown `op` returns `None`
3. **No input validation**, **Fragile string-based dispatch**
4. **Missing type hints**, **Missing docstring**

## Doc Writer — Suggested Docstring
```python
def calc(x, y, op):
    """Perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
    Args:
        x (float): The first operand.
        y (float): The second operand.
        op (str): The operation to perform ("add", "sub", "mul", "div").
    Returns:
        float: The result of the arithmetic operation.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If op is not one of the supported operations.
        ZeroDivisionError: If op is "div" and y is 0.
    """
```
```

**Verdict:** PASS - Two AgentDefinition subagents (code_reviewer with sonnet, doc_writer with haiku) delegated via the Agent tool. Both complete their tasks and results are aggregated by the orchestrator.

## 12_cost_tracking.py

```
$ uv run python 12_cost_tracking.py

=== Example 1: Cost and Usage Tracking ===
Result: A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is
a standardized architectural style for building web services that allows different systems
to communicate over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Cost: $0.007165
Turns: 1
Duration: 3036ms (API: 3030ms)
Usage: {'input_tokens': 3, 'cache_creation_input_tokens': 905, 'cache_read_input_tokens':
8242, 'output_tokens': 86, 'server_tool_use': {'web_search_requests': 0, ...},
'service_tier': 'standard', ...}

=== Example 2: Limit Max Turns ===
Stopped after 3 turns
Stop reason: end_turn
Result: Here's a summary of all the Python files found in the project...

=== Example 3: Budget Cap ===
Result: Paris is the capital of France.
Cost: $0.006112
Budget limit: $0.05

=== Example 4: Effort Level ===
[Low effort] Result: 4
Duration: 2043ms
```

**Verdict:** PASS - All four controls demonstrated: cost/usage tracking with total_cost_usd and usage dict, max_turns=3 limiting agent rounds, max_budget_usd=0.05 capping spend, and effort="low" for fast simple answers.

---

## 13_file_checkpointing.py

```
$ uv run python 13_file_checkpointing.py

Working directory: /var/folders/.../claude_checkpoint_s24rlq_a
Initial file content: Original content: Hello World

=== Turn 1: Modify the file ===
Checkpoint UUID: 7a7f23c7-6580-4060-9f6f-fed40fd62f4c
Result: Done! Read example.txt (contained "Original content: Hello World"),
then overwrote it with "Modified by agent: version 2".
File now contains: Modified by agent: version 2

=== Turn 2: Modify again ===
File now contains: Modified again: version 3

=== Rewinding to Turn 1 checkpoint ===
File after rewind: Original content: Hello World
```

**Verdict:** PASS - File checkpointing enabled with `enable_file_checkpointing=True` and `extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None}`. Agent modifies file across two turns, then `rewind_files()` restores the file to its original state by resuming the session with an empty prompt.
