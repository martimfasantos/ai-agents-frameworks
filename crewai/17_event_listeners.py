-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore CrewAI with the following features:
- Custom event listeners using BaseEventListener
- Listening to crew, agent, task, and tool events
- Real-time monitoring and logging of crew execution

Event listeners provide a powerful way to monitor and react to
events during crew execution. You can track when crews start/stop,
agents begin/finish, tasks complete, and tools are used.
