-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Pydantic AI with the following features:
- Creating a basic Agent with a system prompt
- Synchronous execution with run_sync
- Accessing the agent's output

This is the simplest possible Pydantic AI agent. It demonstrates the
minimal setup needed to create and run an agent that responds to a
single user prompt.
