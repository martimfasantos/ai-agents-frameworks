"""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Pydantic AI with the following features:
- Connecting to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with MCPToolset
- Running an in-process MCPServer so the example needs no subprocess
- Using MCP tools as agent toolsets
- PrefixedToolset to namespace MCP tool names and avoid collisions

MCP is an open protocol that lets AI agents discover and use tools
exposed by external servers. MCPToolset is built on the FastMCP client,
so it accepts anything FastMCP can build a transport from: an HTTP/SSE
URL, a stdio script path, a pre-built client, or -- as used here -- an
in-process MCPServer instance.

NOTE: v2 replaced MCPServerStdio/MCPServerSSE/MCPServerStreamableHTTP with
the single MCPToolset, which takes one positional argument instead of a
command plus args. Its `tool_prefix` argument was removed repo-wide; wrap
the toolset in PrefixedToolset instead.
