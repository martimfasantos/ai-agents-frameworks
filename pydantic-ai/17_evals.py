-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Pydantic Evals with the following features:
- Defining evaluation cases with inputs and expected outputs
- Creating datasets of test cases
- Running evaluate_sync to score agent responses
- Inspecting the EvaluationReport for pass/fail results

Pydantic Evals provides a structured way to test and evaluate AI agent
behavior. By defining cases with expected outputs, you can systematically
verify that your agents produce correct results and catch regressions
when models or prompts change.
