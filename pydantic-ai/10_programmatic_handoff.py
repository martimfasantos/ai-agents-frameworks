-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Pydantic AI with the following features:
- Multi-Agent Applications patterns
- Multiple agents called in succession by application code (not via tools)
- Passing message history between agent runs for context continuity
- Shared usage tracking across multiple agent runs
- Application code orchestrates which agent runs next

Programmatic hand-off differs from agent delegation by having application code
control the workflow rather than agents calling each other. Each specialized
agent runs independently, and the application passes context via message history
between runs. This is useful when the orchestration logic is deterministic.
