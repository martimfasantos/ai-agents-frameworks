```
=== LangGraph Hello World ===

User: Where does 'hello world' come from?
AI: The phrase "Hello, World!" is famously known as a simple program used to illustrate the basics of programming in various languages. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1970s and the first edition of the C programming language. The phrase was used in the book "The C Programming Language," written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which was published in 1978.

In the book, a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen serves as an introductory example for demonstrating the syntax of the C language. Since then, "Hello, World!" has become a standard first program for beginners learning to code in many programming languages, symbolizing the start of their programming journey.
