-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Google ADK with the following features:
- Wrapping agents as tools using AgentTool
- Composing specialist agents under an orchestrator agent
- Using built-in google_search and BuiltInCodeExecutor within sub-agents

In ADK, one agent can call another agent as if it were a tool. This is
different from sub-agent delegation — the orchestrator retains control,
calls the specialist, receives its result, and continues. Here an
orchestrator delegates search to a search agent and code execution to a
coding agent.
