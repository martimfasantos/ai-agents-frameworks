-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Google ADK with the following features:
- to_mcp_server: publishing a whole ADK agent as an MCP server
- Single-tool exposure: the agent's own tools stay private to the agent
- Progress notifications: intermediate agent text streamed to the MCP host
- Per-connection sessions: successive tool calls form one conversation

This is the exact inverse of 11_mcp_tools.py. There an ADK agent *consumed*
an external MCP server; here the ADK agent *is* the MCP server, so any MCP
host (an IDE, a coding agent, another framework) can delegate work to it
without importing ADK. We drive it with an in-memory MCP client so the
example stays self-contained instead of blocking on a stdio transport.
