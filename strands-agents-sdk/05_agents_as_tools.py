"""
-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Strands Agents SDK with the following features:
- Agents-as-tools multi-agent pattern
- Passing agents directly in the tools list (auto-converted)
- Using agent.as_tool() for custom name/description
- Orchestrator agent that routes to the right specialist

Since v1.34, Strands can auto-wrap Agent instances passed in the tools
list. You can also use agent.as_tool() to customise the tool name,
description, and context behaviour (e.g. preserve_context=True).
